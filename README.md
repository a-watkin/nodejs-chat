# Nodejs snippets and a async web app messaging service

## Snippets are on basic Node.js functionality

### The async web app messaging service found in static-server

Messages can be posted by multiple clients and automatically update.
The messages are stored on a Mongodb database.

Uses:
1. Express
2. Socket.io 
3. Mongodb, with mLab and Mongoos
4. Jasmine
5. Dotenv
6. Nodemon
7. jQuery

There are examples of TDD and BDD techniques and I have included my notes.
